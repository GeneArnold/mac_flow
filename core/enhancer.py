"""Groq LLM text enhancement.

Takes raw Whisper transcript and optionally cleans or rewrites it using Llama.

Modes:
  raw     — return transcript completely unchanged (no API call)
  clean   — fix grammar, punctuation, remove filler words ("um", "uh", etc.)
  rewrite — turn rambling speech into polished, well-structured prose

Why the meta-response guard exists:
    When Whisper returns very short or odd text, Llama may respond with a
    message like "There is no text to correct" instead of the corrected text.
    We detect these meta-phrases and fall back to the raw transcript so the
    user doesn't have that sentence injected into their document.
